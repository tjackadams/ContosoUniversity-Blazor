# ContosoUniversity

- .NET Core 3.1
- Blazor


This is as close to a direct port of the [Razor Pages](https://github.com/jbogard/ContosoUniversityDotNetCore-Pages) version by the amazing [Jimmy Bogard](https://jimmybogard.com/). I will try to keep this project upto date with the latest developments in the Blazor framework.


## Credits :clap:

This project would not have been possible without the incredible work that has gone on into the following libraries. There is also the amazing work the blazor team is doing :raised_hands:
